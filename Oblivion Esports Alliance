  The **Oblivion Alliance** (OBL) is a newly created alliance. Founded on 23/9/19.
  Due to differents in opinions and playstyle focus, We have left our previous family
  with hopes in building solid and competitive clans. **STYX** is our alliance pride,
  housing many experienced and semi competitive players. They can also be found on the 
  Local International Top 100 leaderboards. We also have a state of the art discord server.
  We are planning to max it at 6 clans since we prefer quality over quantity.
  We all share a same passion for the game,we are friendly, always donate and to
  help each other out with the same goal: to always improve our skills and have a great time!
  We plan to make this alliance a *COMPETITIVE ALLIANCE* but we welcome *SEMI COMPETITIVE*
  players too! We have people from all parts of the world! Join Oblivion and lets make history together!
